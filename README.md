# iOS-WorkShop---March-1st

This repo contains the Project Spec, Solution and Xcode Playground used in the demo.
Remember, that the solution to the project is just one of many. It is bare bones,
and could have more functionality, better UI and better functionality. Use it as a
base from where you can build up and create an even better To Do List app!

If you have any questions about the project, and/or programming for iOS contact me:
