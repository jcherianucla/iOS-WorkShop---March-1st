# iOS-WorkShop---March-1st

This repo contains the Project Spec, Solution and Xcode Playground used in the demo.
Remember, that the solution to the project is just one of many. It is bare bones,
and could have more functionality, better UI and better functionality. Use it as a
base from where you can build up and create an even better To Do List app!

Steps to download:
1.) Open up the terminal and type the following:
2.) cd ~/Desktop
3.) git clone https://github.com/jcherianucla/iOS-WorkShop---March-1st

This will clone the repo onto your desktop. You must have a github account to do this
so set one up! You may be prompted to type in your username and password in the
terminal, so go ahead and do that.
